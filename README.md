# Simply Supported Beam 
This is a user-friendly web application that allows you to input values like load magnitude, beam length, and load position. Based on this input, it generates shear force and bending moment diagrams. You can also use it to find the specific shear force and bending moment at any point along the beam. Additionally, the application lets you visualize how the shear force and bending moment diagrams change as you adjust the load position.
